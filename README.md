# Pandas-Challenge-1

This project analyzes client order data to identify the top clients by order quantity and total spending. The goal is to provide insights into client behavior and profitability, which can inform business decisions and strategies. I was provided assistance by some of my classmates, Edward Adigun and Jennifer Galvan. Sean Morey, the instructor of the class, was a big help. I lastly received assistance from Nomsa Tsotetsi, a BCS tutor. I also could not have been able to finish this code without the help from the BCS Xpert Learning Assistant.

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:**
   - Loaded the dataset containing client orders.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Calculated additional columns such as `line_subtotal`, `total_weight`, `shipping_price`, `line_cost`, and `line_profit`.
   - Formatted monetary columns to reflect amounts in millions of dollars.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Identified the top 5 clients by total order quantity.
   - Calculated the total spending, shipping cost, revenue, cost, and profit for these top clients.
   - Sorted the data by total profit to highlight the most profitable clients.

## Results

The analysis revealed the following key insights:
- The top 5 clients by order quantity were identified, with their total spending and profitability calculated.
- Client ID 24741 emerged as the most profitable client, contributing significantly to the overall profitability.
